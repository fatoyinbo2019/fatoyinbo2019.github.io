<br> my achievement will surely reflect at the time that i was called upon by my school to participate in an inter school debate competition.</br>
<br> i was really nervous because i didnt have the courage to face the crowd. but wih the help</br>
<br> my parents,God and friends, i was able summon such outrageous courage.</br>
<br> it was a normal routine for me to stay behind after classes for the tutorial and encouragement for the competition.</br>
<br> the d day had already come when me up asearly as 4.o clock for revision.</br>
<br> i was absolutely confident about this competition.</br>
<br> During the tutorial earlier, i picked the two wirds from the teacher which are COMPOSURE and CONFIDENCE.</br>
<br> i held on to these tow magic words for that the</br> 
<br> when i got to the venue, i was intimidated by the way the judges were looking like but with time i shrugged it off.</br>
<br> when it was my turn,i took the bull by its horn and when straight to the point. The jugdes were impressed with the way i composed myself.</br>
<br> At the end of the debates, the judges were full of my praises and eventually gave me my reward which was a gold medal and the cup for my school.</br>
<br> i could actually say that is my best ever achievement.</br>
